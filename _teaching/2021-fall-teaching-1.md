## Statement of Reasonable Accommodation

Reasonable accommodations are available for students with a documented disability. If you have a disability and need accommodations to fully participate in this class, please either visit or call the Access Center (Washington Building 217; 509-335-3417) to schedule an appointment with an Access Advisor. All accommodations MUST be approved through the Access Center. For more information contact a Disability Specialist @ 509-335-3417, http://accesscenter.wsu.edu, Access.Center@wsu.edu.

## Campus Safety Information

Review the Campus Safety Plan (http://safetyplan.wsu.edu/) and visit the Office of Emergency Management website (http://oem.wsu.edu/) for a comprehensive listing of university policies, procedures, statistics, and information related to campus safety, emergency management, and the health and welfare of the campus community.


## Cheating Policy

Limited cooperation among students on homework assignments and programming projects is encouraged. Students may discuss meaning of the assignments and possible directions on how to solve the problems. However, any written portion of an assignment MUST be the student’s work. Copying from other students or allowing other students to copy your work is considered to be cheating and will result in a reduced or a failing grade.

## Assignments (Homework and Projects)

Please read the instructions included in each homework assignment about how to submit your assignment and on late submission policy. Assignments that are submitted beyond the allowed time frame will not be graded.  A tutorial document on how to install and use the Keil software is provided on the course website.

## Hardware Components

You will be working on hands-on projects. You will need to purchase a number of hardware components for your projects. A list of the components is provided [here](https://github.com/mahdipedro/mahdipedro.github.io/blob/master/files/CptS466_566_Componentsv3.pdf).

## Grading Policy
 *	There will be one midterm exam (15%), one final exam (15%), and approximately 10 assignments (70%).
 *	The letter-grade equivalencies are based on lower bound thresholds of 90, 87, 83, 80, 77, 73, 70, 67, 63, and 60 for letter-grades of ‘A’, ‘A-‘, ‘B+’, ‘B’, ‘B-‘, ‘C+’, ‘C’, ‘C-‘, ‘D+’, and ‘D’, respectively. An overall course score of below 60 translates into an ‘F’ letter-grade. In short, the letter equivalencies are as follows. ‘A’≥=90; 87≤’A-‘<90; 83≤’B+'<87; 80≤’B'<87; 77≤’B-‘<80; 73≤’C+'<77; 70≤’C'<73; 67≤’C-‘<70; 63≤’D+'<67; 60≤’D'<63; F<60.
