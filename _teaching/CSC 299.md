## Course Description
CSC 299 stresses student initiative in investigating a particular application of computing. In the process, students learn new tools (including languages and APIs) methodologies, study algorithms/code examples/formalisms used in that particular computing area, work on projects, and apply them to develop operating systems.
The topic of study in this section of CSC 299 is Hardware Projects for the Raspberry Pi & the topic of CSE 299 is Hardware Projects. In this course, the students will apply problem-solving and programming skills toward building cyber-physical systems using the Raspberry Pi hardware platform. The course will cover basic electronics and the Python API for managing hardware devices (including communication interfaces), interfacing with digital and analog inputs (sensors), controlling motors (actuators), and using output devices (e.g., displays and buzzers). Throughout the course and final project, students will work in groups to build basic cyber-physical systems (e.g., controlling LEDs and motors, communicating over the Internet, monitoring the surroundings via various sensors) to moderately sophisticated ones (e.g., remotely piloting a robot rover over the Internet).

## Course Objectives
In this course, students will:
 Configure and secure Raspberry Pi for remote operation
 Work and be familiar with the Unix/Linux operating systems to perform system configurations, Python program development, and execution
 Use, be familiar with, and build basic electronic circuits
 Use Raspberry Pi and the Python API to interface digital/analog inputs (sensors), control motors, and other hardware (actuators), and use a variety of displays (output devices).
 Communicate with hardware devices over the Internet
 Build moderately sophisticated cyber-physical systems using the Raspberry Pi.
