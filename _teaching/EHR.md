## Course Description
Electronic Healthcare Record Systems are the foundation for significantly improved healthcare services in the future. It not only serves as a repository for all patient records but has the potential to unify all healthcare information from a wide variety of sources. It has the potential to improve the processes within our healthcare systems. It is also a treasure trove of information, which when mined, can potentially lead to significant discoveries on the treatment of disease. This comprehensive course provides an in-depth understanding of Electronic Health Records (EHR), a critical component in modern healthcare systems. Designed for healthcare professionals, IT specialists, and data analysts, the course covers a wide range of topics from the basics of digital patient records to advanced data analytics using machine learning.

## Learning Objectives
* Digital vs paper patient records
* Definition of EMR, EHR, PHR
* The need for a unified view of our records
* Key components of an EHR system
* The Patient's perspective of EHR
* The Clinicians' perspective of EHR
* Technology Issues of EHR
* Meaningful use of EHR
* The 21st Century "Cures" Act and how it will help.
* Understand the Schema of publicly available EHR databases (MIMIC-III)
* Recognize the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) use
* Extract and visualize descriptive statistics from clinical databases
* Understand and extract key clinical outcomes such as mortality and stay of length
* Train deep learning architectures such as Multi-layer perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks for classification
* Validate and compare different machine learning algorithms
* Preprocess Electronic Health Records and represent them as time-series data
* Imputation strategies and data encodings

## Required Components
  Students are required to purchase the following items:
  * [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W - 2021](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Zero-Bluetooth-RPi-2W/dp/B09LH5SBPS)
  * [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense](https://www.amazon.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-nRF52840-Sense/dp/B09T94SZ8K/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MJOLG5KGMR7P&keywords=seeed%2Bxiao%2Bsense&qid=1699672428&s=electronics&sprefix=seeed%2Bxiao%2Bsens%2Celectronics%2C99&sr=1-1&th=1)

## Grading 
The course grade is apportioned as follows:
* 20% for quizzes
* 50% for lab assignments and reports 
* 30% for final project	

### Labs
Homework (fillable DOCX forms; no hard copies will be provided in class) will be available on D2L and consist of reading online material to further understand the concepts covered in the course. You will need to complete and submit (via D2L) the weekly assignment before the next class meeting. The template for each of the lab reports will be available on D2L. After completing the lab reports, print them as PDFs and upload them on D2L.

### Quiz
Based on the prior lab and the assignment, a short quiz will be given in class. Quizzes should be completed individually by the next lab meeting.

### Final Project
During the last several weeks of the course, you will be working on a group project, which you will present in week 11 of the class. It will be a simple application you will implement using a Raspberry Pi board and other electronic components. The project will be approved based on your proposal. A final project write-up will be due during exam week. Instructions about the final project will be available on D2L.
