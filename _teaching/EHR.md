## Course Description
Electronic Healthcare Record Systems are the foundation for significantly improved healthcare services in the future. It not only serves as a repository for all patient records but has the potential to unify all healthcare information from a wide variety of sources. It has the potential to improve the processes within our healthcare systems. It is also a treasure trove of information, which, when mined, can potentially lead to significant discoveries on the treatment of disease. This comprehensive course provides an in-depth understanding of Electronic Health Records (EHR), a critical component in modern healthcare systems. Designed for healthcare professionals, IT specialists, and data analysts, the course covers a wide range of topics, from the basics of digital patient records to advanced data analytics using machine learning.

## Learning Objectives
* Digital vs paper patient records
* Definition of EMR, EHR, PHR
* The need for a unified view of our records
* Key components of an EHR system
* The Patient's perspective of EHR
* The Clinicians' perspective of EHR
* Technology Issues of EHR
* Meaningful use of EHR
* The 21st Century "Cures" Act and how it will help.
* Understand the Schema of publicly available EHR databases (MIMIC-III)
* Recognize the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) use
* Extract and visualize descriptive statistics from clinical databases
* Understand and extract key clinical outcomes such as mortality and stay of length
* Train deep learning architectures such as Multi-layer perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks for classification
* Validate and compare different machine learning algorithms
* Preprocess Electronic Health Records and represent them as time-series data
* Imputation strategies and data encodings

## Course Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be equipped with a robust understanding of EHR systems, the ability to analyze health data using advanced machine learning techniques, and a comprehensive perspective on the impact of EHRs on both patients and healthcare professionals. This course prepares attendees to effectively implement, manage, and utilize EHR systems in a healthcare setting, ensuring compliance with modern healthcare regulations and maximizing the benefits of digital health records.
