I am a researcher and educator at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). I am the research lab manager at [Health Aware Bits Lab](https://habitslab.github.io/) (HABits). I also teach [Wireless and Mobile health](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/397-497-14.html) (mHealth) course in winter quarters. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu) (WSU) in 2021 with the guidance of Professor Hassan Ghasemzadeh at [EMIL Lab](https://ghasemzadeh.com/). I currently work on health monitoring projects related to stress detection and eating behavior recognition.
