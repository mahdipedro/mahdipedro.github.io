I am a researcher, educator, and entrepreneur at [DePaul University](https://core.depaul.edu/uwide-info/?utm_content=537768556521&utm_term=depaul%20university&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=extm_uwide-brand&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwzo2mBhAUEiwAf7wjkgupbJuNMHUJ_Jk6q2B89R9m0gzvZLQPUeTENL6RjRjS_6j5hXQihRoCoPIQAvD_BwE), [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), and [SenseWhy](http://sensewhyinc.com/) INC. I am an assistant professor at [DePaul University](https://core.depaul.edu/uwide-info/?utm_content=537768556521&utm_term=depaul%20university&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=extm_uwide-brand&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwzo2mBhAUEiwAf7wjkgupbJuNMHUJ_Jk6q2B89R9m0gzvZLQPUeTENL6RjRjS_6j5hXQihRoCoPIQAvD_BwE), the research lab manager at [Health Aware Bits Lab](https://habitslab.github.io/) (HABits) and the CTO of [SenseWhy](http://sensewhyinc.com/) INC. I also teach [Wireless and Mobile health](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/397-497-14.html) (mHealth) course in winter quarters. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu) (WSU) in 2021 with the guidance of Professor Hassan Ghasemzadeh at [EMIL Lab](https://ghasemzadeh.com/). I currently work on health monitoring projects related to stress detection and eating behavior recognition.
