I post interesting quotes or my personal experience here. It is not precisely my diary, but you may find some valuable lessons here.

  - People think that the purpose of personal memory is to remember the past. That is not the purpose of memory! The purpose of the memory is to extract from past lessons to structure the future. For example, when you have a traumatic memory, if you analyze that memory and figure out how you put yourself at risk and determine how to avoid that in the future, then the emotion associated with that would go away.
  - You don't get away with anything. You might think you can bend the fabric of reality and treat people instrumentally. But there will be a time that you will pay the piper! When you pay, you may not even notice the cause or the connection between the sin and the payment.
