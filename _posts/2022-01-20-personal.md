The purpose of this project was to build a wearable system that can be used for reliable ankle edema quantification. Ankle edema is an important symptom for monitoring patients with chronic systematic diseases. It is an important indicator of onset or exacerbation of a variety of diseases that disturb cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic system such as heart, liver, and kidney failure, diabetes, etc. SmartSock is a real-time and activity-sensitive wearable system for monitoring ankle edema.

I post interesting quotes or my personal experience here. It is not precisely my diary, but you may find some valuable lessons here.
