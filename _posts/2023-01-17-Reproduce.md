## How to Perform Reproducibility Testing

1. Establish a Goal

• Collect type A uncertainty data,

• Validate a new calibration or test method,

• Evaluate the quality and consistency of laboratory results,

• Investigate factors that cause measurement uncertainty or error.

2. Determine What You Will Test or Measure
We need to choose:

• When you will perform the test (Time),

• Where you will perform the test (Environment),

• How you will perform the test (Method),

• What you will use to perform the test (Equipment),

• Who you will perform the test (Operator).

3. Select a Variable or Condition to Change
4. Perform a Test With Variable A
5. Perform a Test With Variable B
6. Analyze the Results
