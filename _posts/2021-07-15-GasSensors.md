In this post I explain how we can select the right CO2 sensor for a project. There are certian points that neeed to be condifered before sensor selection which includes:

1- Cost of the Sensor: How much you would like to spend on the sensor. The price range of CO2 sensors is from $2.5 to hundreds of dollars.
2- Power Conumption: Gas sensors are often considered power-hungry sensors especially if we compare them to other sensors such as motion, pressure, or temperature sensors.
3- Operation Temperature: In what kind of environment are we going to use the sensor. For example, Is the temperature going below 0â„ƒ?
4- Measurement Range:
5- Response Time:
6- Lifespan:
7- Size of the Module:
8- Measurement Principle:
