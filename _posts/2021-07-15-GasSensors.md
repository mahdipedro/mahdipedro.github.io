I have been invloved with a project that required us to use gas sensors. I had to do research on these sensors to select the right sensor for our project. In this post I explain how we can select the right CO2 sensor for a project. There are certian points that neeed to be condifered before sensor selection which includes:

1- Cost of the Sensor: How much you would like to spend on the sensor. The price range of CO2 sensors is from $2.5 to hundreds of dollars.

2- Power Conumption: Gas sensors are often considered power-hungry sensors especially if we compare them to other sensors such as motion, pressure, or temperature sensors.

3- Operation Temperature: In what kind of environment are we going to use the sensor. For example, Is the temperature going below 0â„ƒ?

4- Measurement Range: What is the required measurement range for the application? For example, CO2 concentration below 1000ppm is safe for humans. However, at higher levels, around 2500 ppm, there are significant reductions in cognitive functioning, especially for tasks that require higher-level thinking. And finally, CO2 levels above 50,000ppm can cause humans to lose consciousness which can lead to death, f this occurs for long enough.
